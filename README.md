# MediGuard
Write a program using C, C++, Java or Python to carry out medical data processing as follows:

The program writes into and reads from a configuration file the following parameters: user names, hashes of passwords (MD5), user type (patient or hospital staff category), privilege level of each user name (you need to assume appropriate privilege levels) (Note: you may use a comma separated records, XML, or similar. What is necessary is to somehow write into the file, and not necessary to focus on interfaces and how you do it in a fancy way)
The program writes into and reads from a data file the following data records: personal details, sickness details, drug prescriptions, and lab test prescriptions. Each data record is associated with a sensitivity level depending on its nature. 
Each data record is due to an encounter with a patient
Hospital staff can read or write data based on account privilege level and sensitivity level of data
